# https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions#jobs
# Rather than use a single job with a linear pipeline of steps, you may be
# tempted to make each step into a separate job and specify the dependencies
# using the `needs` syntax for more parallelism.
# However, data cannot be shared between jobs because each job will be run on a
# different runner. Even on a self-hosted runner, the `needs` syntax does not
# guarantee that the data can be shared!

# Using if: always() allows all steps to run, while still properly reporting failure.
